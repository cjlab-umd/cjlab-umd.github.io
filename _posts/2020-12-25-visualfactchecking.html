Determining the veracity of a factual claim made by public figures, aka 'fact-checking', is a common task of the journalists in the newsrooms. One critical challenge that they face while fact-checking is- they have to swift through a large amount of text to find claims that are checkworthy. While there exist some computational methods for automating the fact-checking process, little research has been done on how a system should combine such techniques with visualizations to assist journalists. ClaimViz is a visual analytic system that integrates machine learning methods with interactive visualizations to facilitate the fact-checking process for journalists. The design of ClaimViz is based on analyzing the requirements of real fact-checkers and our case studies demonstrate how the system can help users to effectively spot and verify claims.
