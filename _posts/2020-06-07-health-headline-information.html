Mass media plays a central role in delivering science-based crisis, risk, and healthcare information to the general public. However, we have shown a gap between what scholars and expert practitioners advise based on scientific guidelines and what mass media communicates about risk and healthcare. This project test AI, NLP, and data visualization methods to see how well they can close the gap between best practices in communicating science-based knowledge and current mass media practices focusing primarily on news stories. Our approach can  assist mass media content creators in preparing effective and high-quality health information that conforms to science-based criteria, and assist media consumers in finding the highest quality information.
