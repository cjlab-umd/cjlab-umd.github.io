<div style="text-align: justify">
In October 2017, there happened the uprising of an unprecedented online movement
on social media by people across the world who started publicly sharing their
untold stories of being sexually harassed along with the hashtag #MeToo (or some
variants of it). Those stories did not only strike the silence that had long hid
 the perpetrators, but also allowed victims to discharge some of their bottled-up
  grievances, and revealed many important information surrounding sexual harassment.
   In this project, we tap into social media (Twitter) to understand the dynamics
   of the #MeToo movement- who participated, what harassment did they go through, and
   what's the relationship between the victims and the perpetrators. We aim to
   advance the discussion on the potential role of online social media in breaking
   the silence of victims by factoring in the strengths and limitations of these platforms.
