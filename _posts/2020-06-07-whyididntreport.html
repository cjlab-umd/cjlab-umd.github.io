<div style="text-align: justify">
Sexual violence is a serious problem across the globe. A lot of victims, particularly women, go through this experience.

Unfortunately, not all of these violent incidents come to public. A large portion of victims don't disclose their experience. On the September of 2018, people started revealing in Twitter why they didn't report a sexual violence experience using a hashtag #WhyIDidntReport. We collect about 40K such tweets and conduct a large-scale supervised analysis of why victims don't report. Our study finds the extent to which people shared their reasons as well as categorizes the reasons into finer reasons. We also analyze user engaged with the victims and compare our findings with existing literature.
