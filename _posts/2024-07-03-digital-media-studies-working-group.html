The Digital Media Studies Working Group helps scholars at all levels apply computer-based techniques to advance research in media history and analysis. One goal is to create a community of scholars to offer specific technical assistance, consulting and collaboration for researchers working on appropriate projects. Scholars who work with us are asked to provide credit to the Computational Journalism Lab at the University of Maryland and the members of the working group who provided assistance. People who request assistance can join the working group if they choose.
